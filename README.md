# Long discription

# ABSTRACT:
    The prominent aim of this project is to halt the unlawful slice of trees 
# PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
    
   In this application, we attempted to discourage and preserve the trees from illegal theft. The users are provided with login credentials to enter into the dashboard. Those unmatched username and passwords will not be permitted to view it. By using this application,we have a feature called “CUT TREE”,here one would get a proper authorization for cutting of trees by entering the reason, tree type, number of trees,coordinates ,etc....By this the applicant can legally cut the trees by getting approval and also the information regarding this will be updated to the database.
    Similarly, “PLANT TREE” prompts the user to update the status of the new saplings to be planted and name of the saplings ,growth and maintenance of the same. The “View Deforestation Graph” shows us the pictorial representation of the percentage of deforestation over a series of years. Besides that we have a similar characteristic called  “ View Afforestation Graph” and it plots the percentage of Afforestation and the corresponding year.
    Another appreciable feature we have is "Awareness", which will direct the user to an environmental blog that will definitely provide the awareness kit to the user.
